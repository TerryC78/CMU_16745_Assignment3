# Dynamic-Optimization-Assigment3
CMU RI 16-745: Dynamic Optimization: Assignment 3

This assignment explores trajectory optimization. Given a set of footstep locations and timing, the objective is to find an optimal (COM) center of mass trajectory. We use a simplified model, the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM), to model the biped robot's walking. Full specifications of the assignment are given [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cga/dynopt/ass3/).

The assignment is implemented entirely in MATLAB. To run the DDP implementation of Part 1, run `p1_ddp_run.m`. To run the CMA-ES implementation of Part 2, run `p2_cmaes_run.m`. The writeup is located at [http://vietletruc.com/trajectory-optimization](http://vietletruc.com/trajectory-optimization).
